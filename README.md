## My process
1. First of all, I started out with the normal HTMl semantic structure(head, body.....footer).
2. Furthermore, I created my card component and added the images alongside the subsequent text.
3. Thirdly I moved into my stylesheet and designed what my page should look like using flexbox and some other css custom properties.
4. Finally, launched the final outcome on Github Pages.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
1. I discovered how to effectly use the css combinators, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.
2. Got some new flexbox tricks.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.freecodecamp.org) - This helped me understand the effective usage of flexbox.
- (https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand responsive media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
